# Project Brief: None

## Project Type
Single Page Application (SPA) - Task Management System

## Project Goals (Golden Context)
Build a responsive, feature-rich task management application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks efficiently. The application should demonstrate modern SPA architecture with clean UI, smooth navigation, and effective state management while following best practices for code organization and maintainability.

## Complexity
Moderate complexity. The application involves standard CRUD operations, state management with Redux, routing, and responsive design. While core functionality is straightforward, implementing proper state management, error handling, and loading states adds complexity.

## Tech Stack
React 18+ with hooks, Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router v6 for client-side routing, Material-UI for components, Axios for API communication, ES6+ JavaScript, Vite for build tooling, Jest and React Testing Library for testing.
