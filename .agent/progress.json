    "Set up the Redux store infrastructure. This involves creating the root store configuration (`src/store/index.js`) and the necessary slices to manage the application state: `tasksSlice.js` (handling task CRUD logic), `categoriesSlice.js` (managing task categories), and `uiSlice.js` (managing global UI states like notifications, modals, and loading states)."
