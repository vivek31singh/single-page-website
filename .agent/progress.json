    "Set up the Redux store infrastructure. This involves creating the root store configuration (`src/store/index.js`) and the necessary slices to manage the application state: `tasksSlice.js` (handling task CRUD logic), `categoriesSlice.js` (managing task categories), and `uiSlice.js` (managing global UI states like notifications, modals, and loading states)."

  "last_commit": "feat: implement Redux store infrastructure with task, category, and UI slices\n\nCreated complete Redux Toolkit slices for state management:\n- tasksSlice.js: Handles task CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and status toggling with async thunks\n- categoriesSlice.js: Manages task categories with default categories and CRUD operations\n- uiSlice.js: Manages global UI states including notifications, modals, sidebar, and dark mode\n\nAll slices include proper loading states, error handling, selectors, and actions following Redux Toolkit best practices."
