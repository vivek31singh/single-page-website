    "Set up the Redux store infrastructure. This involves creating the root store configuration (`src/store/index.js`) and the necessary slices to manage the application state: `tasksSlice.js` (handling task CRUD logic), `categoriesSlice.js` (managing task categories), and `uiSlice.js` (managing global UI states like notifications, modals, and loading states).",
    "Create the root application component (`src/App.jsx`) and the routing configuration (`src/router.jsx`). This involves setting up the `BrowserRouter`, defining the main route for the Dashboard, and wrapping the application in the Redux `Provider` to ensure the store is available to all components."
